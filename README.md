#Welcome to James

James is a tool that makes visible the entire **universe** of **JSON** objects connections `through a graph`. This will help you see more easily how to Json is modeled. For example, based on the graph you can make `decisions in order to improve` the entire model.

#Usage

To start using follow the **instruction** below. It require you have already installed git and npm.

###grunt serve

Assuming that the Grunt CLI has been installed, it's very easy to start working with Grunt.

    git clone https://github.com/tonysilva/james.git
    cd james
    npm install
    bower install

To avoid errors with Jit library: change in bower.json file (within the bower_components folder) the "main" property to look like this: **"main":"Jit/jit.js"**. You can now continue.

    grunt serve

Now you will see James is working in the **browser** - http://localhost:9000.
